# Phase 5 Development Plan – Authentication & Shell Foundation

**Version:** 2.0 (refined from interview-locked decisions and intended to supersede/expand the current Phase 5 plan)  
**Purpose:** This document defines the comprehensive Phase 5 implementation plan for a production-ready HB Intel authentication and shell foundation that satisfies the dual PWA / SPFx operating model. It consolidates the architectural direction established in the current Phase 5 plan and hard-locks the additional interview decisions around runtime mode handling, shell governance, permission modeling, override administration, degraded-mode behavior, release gating, and documentation standards.  
**Audience:** Implementation agent(s), technical reviewers, product owner, operations/support stakeholders, and future maintainers.  
**Implementation Objective:** Deliver a production-ready auth shell package that behaves as one HB Intel product across PWA and SPFx, while preserving tightly bounded environment-specific integrations and a clear future path for later governance, observability, and admin-surface expansion.

## 5.9 Protected Feature Registration Contract

1. No protected feature may self-wire directly into shell access patterns without registration.

2. Define a standard registration contract that includes at minimum:
   - feature identifier
   - route metadata
   - navigation visibility metadata
   - required feature-level permission(s)
   - required action permission(s)
   - locked/discoverable visibility designation if applicable
   - shell mode compatibility metadata

3. Provide a documented extension path for exceptional features that need richer integration later.

4. Enforce registration usage through code review and automated linting / boundary restrictions where practical.

## Recommended Implementation Sequence

1. Lock ADRs and package boundaries.
2. Implement provider abstraction and runtime detection.
3. Implement session normalization and auth store.
4. Implement role-mapping and permission resolution.
5. Implement guards, redirects, and recovery surfaces.
6. Implement shell core and shell-status derivation.
7. Integrate the existing connectivity bar as unified shell-status UI.
8. Implement degraded mode and section-level freshness rules.
9. Implement feature registration contract and enforcement.
10. Implement access-control backend model.
11. Implement minimal production admin UX.
12. Implement override approval / renewal / emergency workflows.
13. Implement audit and retention flows.
14. Execute dual-mode validation matrix.
15. Complete documentation package and release sign-off artifacts.

## Final Phase 5 Definition of Done

Phase 5 is done when HB Intel has a production-ready authentication and shell foundation that:
- behaves as one product across PWA and SPFx,
- uses centralized session and authorization truth,
- enforces protected access consistently,
- supports governed exceptions without contaminating base roles,
- provides safe degraded-mode behavior,
- leverages the existing connectivity bar as the canonical shell-status surface,
- enables production operations through core admin workflows,
- satisfies formal validation, audit, release, and documentation requirements,
- and explicitly documents every deferred future expansion path so later phases can extend the platform without re-architecting the foundation.
