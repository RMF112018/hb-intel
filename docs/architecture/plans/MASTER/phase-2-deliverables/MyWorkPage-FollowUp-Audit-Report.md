# MyWorkPage Phase 2 — Follow-Up Audit Report

**Date:** 2026-03-22
**Auditor:** Claude (automated, architecture governance)
**Scope:** Full re-verification of all findings from the original audit (`MyWorkPage-Audit-Report.md`), covering every remediation phase (0–7) against current implementation state.
**Files examined:** 38 implementation files + 5 test files + 1 ADR

---

## Executive Summary

The Phase 2 implementation is **substantially complete**. Thirty-four of the original thirty-six audit findings are fully resolved. Two narrow spec deviations remain open and must be addressed before final sign-off.

| Category | Count |
|---|---|
| Original findings (all severities) | 34 findings across 11 categories |
| Fully resolved | **32 findings** |
| Partially resolved | **1 finding (PRS-01)** |
| Not resolved / new deviation | **1 finding (TRZ-01 — new)** |
| Net verdict | **CONDITIONAL GO** |

The implementation demonstrates production-grade quality across architecture, role governance, token compliance, state persistence, freshness/trust, action vocabulary, testing, and documentation. The two remaining items are narrow and do not block core hub functionality, but they represent spec deviations requiring resolution before Phase 2 can be formally closed.

| Finding ID | Description | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| FRS-01 | Split timestamp model (`lastTrustedDataIso` vs `lastRefreshAttemptIso`) | ✅ RESOLVED | `useHubTrustState.ts` implements the split; `lastTrustedDataIso` updated only when `freshness === 'live'`; `useHubTrustState.test.ts` covers all three cases (live, partial, cached) |

### Section 6 — Operating Model / Actions (OPM)

| Finding ID | Description | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| OPM-01 | `useMyWorkActions` from `@hbc/my-work-feed` for action dispatch | ✅ RESOLVED | `HubDetailPanel.tsx` calls `executeAction({ actionKey: action.key, item })`; no `window.location.href` anywhere; `actionVocabulary.test.ts` verifies both |
| UX-F1 | Router-based SPA navigation (no window.location) | ✅ RESOLVED | `HubDetailPanel.tsx`, `RecentActivityCard.tsx`, `QuickActionsSheet.tsx` all use `router.navigate`; `actionVocabulary.test.ts` verifies absence of `window.location.href` |
| UX-F2 | `HubPageLevelEmptyState` derives error state from feed context | ✅ RESOLVED | `HubPageLevelEmptyState.tsx` calls `useMyWork({ enabled: false })` and uses `isError`; no longer receives `isLoadError={false}` statically |

| UIF-018 | Connectivity banner Retry button + success flash | ✅ RESOLVED | `HubConnectivityBanner.tsx` renders Retry button for degraded/offline; success flash with 2s auto-dismiss on reconnect |

### Section 7 — Personalization (PRS)

| Finding ID | Description | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| PRS-01 | `cardArrangement` state flows from page to zones | ✅ RESOLVED | Option (b): vestigial props removed from `HubSecondaryZoneProps` and `useHubPersonalization`. `HbcProjectCanvas` manages tile arrangement via internal config store (`useCanvasConfig` + `CanvasApi`). P2-D5 §4 satisfied through canvas internals. |
| PRS-02 | `updateCardVisibility` callback plumbed to zones | ✅ RESOLVED | Option (b): callback removed. Canvas edit mode provides tile visibility management (add/remove tiles, drag-to-reorder). |

| UIF-016 | CSS `order` property for narrow-viewport zone reordering | ✅ RESOLVED | `HubZoneLayout.tsx`: `secondaryZone` `order:-1`, `tertiaryZone` `order:1`; `rightPanel` `display:contents` at narrow viewport |
| UIF-018 | Connectivity banner Retry + success flash | ✅ RESOLVED | (see OPM section) |
| UIF-021/033/034 | Responsive grid tiers complete | ✅ RESOLVED | `HubZoneLayout.tsx`: Mobile `1fr`, sm-tablet `1fr` with 20px gap, tablet `3fr 2fr`, desktop `7fr 5fr` |

## Open Findings

### PRS-01 / PRS-02 — Card Arrangement Props Removed (Option B) ✅ RESOLVED

**Resolution:** Vestigial `cardArrangement` and `updateCardVisibility` props removed from `HubSecondaryZoneProps` and `useHubPersonalization`. `HbcProjectCanvas` manages tile arrangement and visibility through its internal config store (`useCanvasConfig` + `CanvasApi.saveConfig()`). P2-D5 §4 is satisfied through canvas internals — the page-level draft was dead code from a pre-canvas design.

**Changes:** Removed `IMyWorkCardArrangement`, `ICardSlot` types, `cardArrangement` draft key/TTL, `updateCardVisibility` callback, and all prop threading from `MyWorkPage` → `HubSecondaryZone`. Added inline documentation in `HubSecondaryZone.tsx`, `useHubPersonalization.ts`, and `hubStateTypes.ts` explaining that canvas manages its own config.

---

### TRZ-01 — HubTertiaryZone `editable={false}` Contradicts P2-D2 §5.3
**Severity:** Low
**File:** `HubTertiaryZone.tsx`

P2-D2 §5.3 specifies that the tertiary zone should support "limited EditMode" — users should be able to configure which tiles appear in the tertiary zone. The current implementation passes `editable={false}` to `HbcProjectCanvas`, which disables the edit mode entry point entirely for that zone.

There is no ADR, comment, or spec amendment explaining this deviation. The `tileGovernance.test.ts` does not test tertiary-zone edit mode availability.

**Note on the `:tertiary` role suffix:** The `role={`${primaryRole}:tertiary`}` pattern in `HubTertiaryZone.tsx` is the intended zone-isolation mechanism. The `ROLE_DEFAULT_TILES` in `canvasDefaults.ts` uses `:tertiary`-suffixed keys for the same purpose, and this is documented in the `README.md`. This is **not** a finding — it is deliberate design.

**Required action:** Either (a) change `editable={false}` to `editable={true}` (or remove the prop to use the canvas default) to restore limited EditMode per spec, or (b) document an explicit deviation in the component header or an ADR citing the rationale.

---

## Architecture Notes (Non-Blocking)

**Tertiary zone `:tertiary` role suffix:** The README documents this design: "Role-default tile layouts are defined in `ROLE_DEFAULT_TILES` (canvasDefaults.ts) for Member, Executive, and Administrator, with `:tertiary` suffixed keys for tertiary zone isolation." This is intentional. The `tileGovernance.test.ts` Gate 3 tests confirm zone isolation via this mechanism.

**`HbcProjectCanvas` managing mandatory tiles and role defaults internally:** Gates 2, 4, and 5 from P2-D2 are handled inside `HbcProjectCanvas` using the `mandatory`/`lockable` tile definition properties and `ROLE_DEFAULT_TILES`. The `HubSecondaryZone` and `HubTertiaryZone` do not call `useCanvasMandatoryTiles` or `useRoleDefaultCanvas` directly. This is a valid architectural delegation and is confirmed by the tileGovernance tests.

## Final Verdict

### CONDITIONAL GO

The Phase 2 implementation satisfies the overwhelming majority of the original audit findings and demonstrates a production-grade implementation of the Personal Work Hub. Core architecture, role governance, token compliance, state persistence, freshness/trust, action vocabulary, testing coverage, and documentation are all in order.

**One item requires resolution before Phase 2 can be formally closed:**

1. **TRZ-01 (Low):** `HubTertiaryZone.tsx` passes `editable={false}` to `HbcProjectCanvas`, contradicting P2-D2 §5.3's requirement for limited EditMode in the tertiary zone. Either restore `editable={true}` or document the deviation with rationale.

PRS-01/PRS-02 have been resolved via option (b) — vestigial props removed and canvas config authority documented. The remaining item does not affect the primary feed zone, role entitlement, freshness/trust, state persistence, action vocabulary, or the pilot-required analytics tiles.
