## Register Statement

This register is the canonical launch-readiness artifact for the Phase 2 first-release pilot. It tracks per-source publication readiness, maps all 13 acceptance gates to evidence, defines the pilot cohort, and provides the launch checklist that gates pilot approval. No pilot launch may proceed without Platform-lead and Product-lead sign-off on this register's readiness status.

---

## Register Scope

### This register governs

- Per-source publication readiness status and integration test tracking
- Acceptance gate evidence inventory (all 13 gates)
- Pilot cohort definition and selection criteria
- Pilot launch checklist
- Rollout posture (Wave 1 start gate, expansion criteria, rollback conditions)
- Named pilot-launch blockers with resolution owners

### This register does NOT govern

- Source classification and readiness gate definitions — see [P2-C1](P2-C1-First-Release-Source-Tranche-Register.md)
- Notification mapping rules — see [P2-C2](P2-C2-Notification-to-Work-Mapping-Policy.md)
- Navigation patterns — see [P2-C3](P2-C3-Work-Item-Navigation-Matrix.md)
- Handoff criteria — see [P2-C4](P2-C4-Handoff-Criteria-Matrix.md)
- Success scorecard and KPI bands — see P2-E3
- Pilot cohort sequencing details — see P2-E5

---

## Definitions

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Publication-ready** | Source has passed all 6 readiness gates (P2-C1 §4) and integration tests confirm correct publication into the hub |
| **Publication-blocked** | Source is required for pilot but has unmet readiness gates — listed as a pilot-launch blocker |
| **Publication-optional** | Source is beneficial but its absence does not block pilot launch |
| **Pilot cohort** | The targeted group of users who receive the `/my-work` Personal Work Hub as their default landing in the first-release rollout |
| **Acceptance gate** | One of 13 Phase 2 pass/fail criteria that must have clear evidence before pilot launch approval |

---

## 1. Publication Readiness Status

Inherited from [P2-C1 §1](P2-C1-First-Release-Source-Tranche-Register.md) with integration test status:

| Source | Module Key | Classification | Gate Status (P2-C1 §4) | Integration Tested | Publication Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Provisioning** | `provisioning` | Required | 6/6 ✅ | ❌ Pending | **Publication-ready** (gates met; integration test pending) |
| **Estimating Bid Readiness** | `estimating-bid-readiness` | Required | 3/6 ❌ | ❌ Blocked | **Publication-blocked** |
| **BD Score Benchmark** | `bd-score-benchmark` | Required | 3/6 ❌ | ❌ Blocked | **Publication-blocked** |
| **BD Strategic Intelligence** | `bd-strategic-intelligence` | Required | 3/6 ❌ | ❌ Blocked | **Publication-blocked** |
| **Project Hub Health Pulse** | `project-hub-health-pulse` | Required | 3/6 ❌ | ❌ Blocked | **Publication-blocked** |
| **Admin Escalations** | `admin` | Optional | Via Provisioning ✅ | ❌ Pending | **Publication-optional** |

### 1.1 Readiness Status Updates

This table is updated as sources progress through readiness gates. Updates require:
- Domain-owner confirmation that gates are met
- Platform-lead review of integration test evidence
- QA sign-off on cross-source deduplication and lane assignment

---

## 2. Integration Test Readiness by Gate

### Gate 5 — Publication

| Test Scenario | Source | Owner | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| BIC registration factory created | All 5 required | Domain leads | Provisioning ✅; others ❌ | `*/bic-registration.ts` |
| App bootstrap wires `registerBicModule()` | All 5 required | Domain leads | Provisioning ✅; others ❌ | App bootstrap files |
| Notification registrations defined | All notification-publishing sources | Platform | Provisioning ✅ (15 events); others ❌ | `*/notification-registrations.ts` |
| Deduplication key format validates | All sources | Platform | ✅ Defined in P2-C1 §5 | Canonical key registry |
| Cross-source dedup tested (BIC + Notification) | Provisioning | QA | ❌ Pending | `@hbc/my-work-feed` test suite |
| Lane assignment correct per priority mapping | All sources | Platform | ❌ Pending | `projectFeed.ts` test coverage |

### Gate 6 — Signal

| Test Scenario | Owner | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Notification tier-to-lane mapping correct | Platform | ✅ Implemented | `notificationAdapter.test.ts` (immediate→do-now, watch→watch, digest→watch) + `assignLane.test.ts` |
| Action URLs resolve on PWA | QA | ✅ Implemented | `buildActionUrl.test.ts` — relative-path contract validated (same paths resolve on PWA) |
| Action URLs resolve on SPFx | QA | ✅ Implemented | `buildActionUrl.test.ts` — same relative-path contract per P2-C2 §13 (SPFx supplies origin) |
| Badge shows immediate-only count | Experience | ✅ Implemented | `HbcNotificationBadge` uses `useNotificationBadge()` which queries `tier: 'immediate', unreadOnly: true` |

### Gate 10 — Continuity

| Test Scenario | Owner | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Return memory restores hub state after domain navigation | Experience/Shell | ✅ Implemented | `useHubReturnMemory` — scroll restore, feed refresh on return, visibilitychange resilience |
| Redirect memory works after auth redirect | Experience/Shell | ✅ Implemented | `redirectMemory.ts` test suite |
| Team mode persists across navigation | Experience/Shell | ✅ Implemented | `useHubStatePersistence` — query-seed auto-save via `useAutoSaveDraft('hbc-my-work-query-seed', 8, 500)` |

### Gate 12 — Handoff

| Test Scenario | Owner | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Provisioning completion handoff creates Project Hub seed | Platform + Project Hub | ✅ Implemented | `onAcknowledged` callback generates seed record ID; `handoff-config.test.ts` validates |
| Health pulse items navigate to Project Hub | Experience | ✅ Implemented | `resolveHealthPulseActionUrl()` produces `/project-hub?projectId=...&view=health`; `resolveHealthPulseActionUrl.test.ts` validates |
| Return from Project Hub restores hub state | Experience/Shell | ✅ Implemented | `useHubReturnMemory` captures scroll + groups on leave, restores on return, triggers feed refresh; `useHubReturnMemory.test.ts` validates |

---

## 4. Pilot Cohort Definition

Per Phase 2 Plan §7.1 (Default release posture):

### 4.1 Selection Criteria

The pilot cohort SHOULD prioritize:

| Criterion | Rationale |
|---|---|
| Users whose workflows are tied to the first-release source tranche | They will have real work items in the hub from day one |
| Users who will benefit most from a credible daily work surface | Users currently reconstructing their workday across multiple tools |
| Elevated roles who need the hybrid personal + team/portfolio experience | Validates team-mode landing and delegated visibility |

### 4.2 Cohort Parameters

| Parameter | Value | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **Cohort size** | To be determined by Product/Adoption | ❌ Not yet defined |
| **Role mix** | Must include standard, elevated, and multi-role users | ❌ Roster pending |
| **Geographic scope** | To be determined | ❌ Not yet defined |
| **Pilot duration** | To be determined | ❌ Not yet defined |
| **Opt-out mechanism** | To be determined (revert to `/project-hub` landing) | ❌ Not yet defined |

### 4.3 Cohort Invariants

- The exact roster is an implementation-governance decision, not a planning blocker (Phase 2 Plan §7.1).
- Cohort selection MUST NOT delay locked specification work.
- Cohort finalization is gated on P2-E5 (Pilot Cohort Rollout and Adoption Sequencing Note).

- [ ] Success scorecard (P2-E3) finalized with measurable criteria — Evidence: P2-E3 spec exists; KPI bands and measurement plan require Product finalization

---

## 6. Rollout Posture

Per Phase 2 Plan §16 locked decision: **Targeted pilot / phased rollout first.**

### 6.1 Wave 1: Pilot Launch

| Aspect | Specification |
|---|---|
| **Start gate** | All pilot launch checklist items (§5) are complete |
| **Scope** | Approved pilot cohort receives `/my-work` as default landing |
| **Duration** | Minimum 2 weeks for meaningful data collection |
| **Monitoring** | Success scorecard metrics tracked from day 1 (P2-E3) |

### 6.2 Wave 2: Broader Rollout

| Aspect | Specification |
|---|---|
| **Expansion gate** | Wave 1 success scorecard passes minimum thresholds |
| **Scope** | Expanded to additional user groups per P2-E5 sequencing |
| **Prerequisites** | All Wave 1 issues resolved; support/adoption team trained |

### 6.3 Rollback Criteria

| Condition | Action |
|---|---|
| Critical publication failure (source data not appearing) | Pause pilot; revert affected cohort to `/project-hub` landing |
| Trust-state failure (stale data served without indicator) | Pause pilot; fix staleness indicators; resume |
| Handoff failure (items routing to wrong surface) | Pause pilot; fix navigation routing; resume |
| Negative user feedback exceeding threshold (P2-E3) | Pause pilot; Product/Adoption review; decide continue/revert |

### 6.4 Rollout Invariants

- Rollback MUST NOT destroy user state — reverting to `/project-hub` landing preserves all feed data and session state.
- Pilot users who opt out MUST be able to return to `/project-hub` default without data loss.
- Rollout expansion requires explicit Product-lead approval — no automatic promotion.

| 13 | Success scorecard not finalized | 14 — Pilot-readiness | Product/Adoption | Pre-launch | ❌ Open — P2-E3 spec exists; KPI bands and measurement thresholds require Product finalization |

### Blocker Resolution Process

- Domain owners update blocker status when gates are met
- Platform lead verifies integration test evidence
- Product lead approves governance and rollout gate resolution
- This register is updated to reflect current status

---

## 8. Acceptance Gate Reference

P2-C5 is primary evidence for two gates:

### Publication Gate

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Gate** | Publication gate |
| **Pass condition** | First-release required sources are classified and launch-critical sources publish correctly |
| **P2-C5 evidence** | Publication readiness status (§1), integration test results (§2) |
| **Primary owner** | Platform + Domain owners |

### Pilot-Readiness Gate

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Gate** | Pilot-readiness gate |
| **Pass condition** | Pilot cohort has defined rollout path and measurable success scorecard |
| **P2-C5 evidence** | Pilot cohort definition (§4), launch checklist (§5), rollout posture (§6), blocker status (§7) |
| **Primary owner** | Adoption / Product |

---

## 9. Locked Decisions

| Decision | Locked Resolution | P2-C5 Consequence |
|---|---|---|
| Rollout posture | **Targeted pilot / phased rollout first** | No company-wide switch on day one; pilot validates before expansion |
| First-release source scope | **Wave 1 business-core scope** | All 5 named sources must pass publication gates before pilot launch |

---

## 10. Register Precedence

| Deliverable | Relationship to P2-C5 |
|---|---|
| **P2-C1** — Source Tranche Register | P2-C5 inherits source classification and gate status from P2-C1 |
| **P2-C2** — Notification Mapping | P2-C5 tracks notification integration test readiness per P2-C2 |
| **P2-C3** — Navigation Matrix | P2-C5 validates navigation scenarios from P2-C3 |
| **P2-C4** — Handoff Criteria | P2-C5 validates handoff scenarios from P2-C4 |
| **P2-E3** — Success Scorecard | P2-E3 defines the success metrics P2-C5 requires for pilot-readiness gate |
| **P2-E5** — Pilot Cohort Sequencing | P2-E5 defines the detailed rollout sequencing that P2-C5's rollout posture summarizes |

This register is updated as blockers are resolved and sources achieve publication-ready status. All updates require Platform-lead approval.
