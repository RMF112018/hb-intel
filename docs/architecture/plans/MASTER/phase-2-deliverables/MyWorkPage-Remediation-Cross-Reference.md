# MyWorkPage Remediation — Audit Findings Cross-Reference

**Source audit:** `MyWorkPage-Audit-Report.md` (2026-03-22)
**Source remediation sequence:** Ordered remediation plan (2026-03-22)
**Purpose:** Each remediation step mapped to every audit finding it closes, partially closes, or provides gate evidence for.

Finding IDs follow the audit report's numbering: plan-reconciliation (`ARC-`, `STT-`, `FRS-`, `ROL-`, `CRD-`, `TM-`, `OPM-`, `PRS-`, `NAV-`), architecture (`ARC-F`), UX (`UX-F`), UI-Kit governance (`D-10`, `MB-08`, `Rule-6`), testing (`TST-F`), documentation (`DOC-`).

Severity codes: **C** = Critical, **H** = High, **M** = Medium, **L** = Low

## Phase 0 — Foundational Prerequisites

### 0-A: Correct the tile namespace ✅ Completed (2026-03-22)

| Finding ID | Severity | Finding Summary | Closure |
|---|---|---|---|
| ARC-05 | **C** | Tile namespace `my-work.analytics.*` instead of `hub:*` (P2-D2 §6.1) | ✅ Closed (2026-03-22) |
| ARC-F2 | **C** | Wrong tile namespace prevents `HbcProjectCanvas` and `useRoleDefaultCanvas` lookup | ✅ Closed (2026-03-22) |
| ARC-09 | **C** | Gates 2–5 all failing — namespace is a prerequisite dependency for all gate evidence | ⚡ Partial — namespace prerequisite satisfied (2026-03-22); downstream gate work remains |

**Findings not yet addressed:** ARC-01 through ARC-04, ARC-06, ARC-07, ARC-F1 remain open. Namespace correction is a prerequisite, not a substitute.
