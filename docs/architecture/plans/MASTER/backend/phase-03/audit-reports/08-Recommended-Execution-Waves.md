# 08 — Recommended Execution Waves

## Recommended wave structure

## Wave 01 — Unblock the live Safety lane and prove repo/live parity
Purpose:
- close the current blocker
- prove the deployed code matches current source
- achieve first successful end-to-end committed Safety ingestion

Scope:
1. deployed artifact parity proof
2. reporting-period Graph read seam repair
3. canonical reporting-period ID contract
4. end-to-end committed write proof
5. preview/commit diagnostics sharpened enough for safe operator use

Success standard:
- live host is proven to run the graph-native ingest code
- preview works
- commit works
- HBCentral list deltas prove persistence
- telemetry clearly shows artifact/version/request/failure details

## Wave 02 — Complete cutover governance and pre-rollout hardening
Purpose:
- convert staging success into rollout-safe architecture

Scope:
1. Graph-only application-facing cutover declaration and residual seam isolation
2. parser-contract adoption as governed authority
3. workbook distribution cleanup (`ParserMeta` hidden)
4. permission tightening and re-proof
5. deployment/hosting-plan release proof tightening
6. observability/runbook hardening

Success standard:
- application-facing Safety lane is explicitly graph-only
- permissions are narrowed and re-proven
- parser contract is governed
- release and incident workflows are supportable

## Optional Wave 03 — Route-surface and host-boundary reduction
Purpose:
- reduce long-term operational blast radius

Scope:
1. continue host-boundary deployment tightening
2. reduce monolithic surface where it provides low value
3. continue architectural cleanup around broad backend façades

Success standard:
- smaller, clearer release scope for the backend surfaces most critical to production operations

## Why this wave split is recommended

This split follows the real dependency order:
- you should not spend time tightening permissions before the live graph path is actually proven to work
- you should not assume the code is the problem until you prove the deployed artifact matches current source
- you should not call the backend production ready until both the Safety write path and the parser contract are proven end-to-end
