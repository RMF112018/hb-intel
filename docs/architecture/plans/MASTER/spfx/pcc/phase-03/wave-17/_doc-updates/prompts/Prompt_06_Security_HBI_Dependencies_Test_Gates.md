# Prompt 06 — Security, HBI, Dependencies, and Test Gates

## Objective

Document security, redaction, audit, HBI guardrails, dependency posture, and test/validation gates.


## Required Instruction Phrase

Do not re-read files that are still within your current context or memory unless you need to verify stale, missing, or contradictory repo truth.

## Working Directory

`/Users/bobbyfetting/hb-intel`

## Global Guardrails

- Documentation-only unless this prompt explicitly says otherwise.
- Do not implement runtime code.
- Do not mutate packages, dependencies, manifests, lockfile, CI, tenants, Graph, SharePoint, Entra, external systems, settings, permissions, schemas, or secrets.
- Do not execute repair.
- Do not create production rollout artifacts.
- Do not make legal/accounting/claim/delay/entitlement determinations.
- Preserve Wave 14, Wave 15, and Wave 16 authority boundaries.


## Allowed Files / Likely Files

- Wave 17 canonical docs under blueprint path.
- Planning closeout doc.

## Prohibited Scope

- Runtime source implementation.
- Broad formatting.
- Package or lockfile changes.
- Tenant or external-system calls.
- SharePoint/Graph/PnP/Entra mutation.
- SPFx packaging/deployment changes.

## Repo-Truth Files to Inspect

- `docs/architecture/blueprint/sp-project-control-center/phase-3/`
- `docs/architecture/blueprint/sp-project-control-center/phase-3/wave-16/`
- `docs/architecture/plans/MASTER/spfx/pcc/phase-03/wave-16/`
- `packages/models/src/pcc/SiteHealth.ts`
- `packages/models/src/pcc/fixtures/siteHealth.ts`
- `packages/project-site-template/schemas/families/site-health.schema.json`
- `packages/project-site-template/fields/families/site-health.fields.json`
- `docs/reference/sharepoint/list-schemas/pcc/List-Map.md`

## Steps


1. Create HBI/security/redaction/audit guardrails doc.
2. Create test and acceptance gates doc.
3. Document no package mutation and no lockfile mutation posture.
4. Document dependency candidates without adding them.
5. Add exact validation and future implementation test matrix.
6. Add placeholder scan evidence using the required phrase scan.


## Validation Commands

```bash
git status --short
git branch --show-current
git rev-parse HEAD
git log --oneline -12
md5 pnpm-lock.yaml
git diff --check
pnpm exec prettier --check <touched markdown/json files>
git diff --name-only
git diff --cached --name-only
```



## Staged-File Proof Before Commit

Before commit, run:

```bash
git diff --cached --name-only
```

Include the staged files in the final response.

## Commit Summary and Description

Use a traditional commit summary.

Subject pattern:

`docs(pcc): <specific Wave 17 documentation update>`

Description must include:
- exact files changed;
- validation commands and outcomes;
- lockfile MD5 before and after;
- no-runtime/no-mutation attestation;
- residual risks.

## Final Output Requirements

Return:
- concise summary;
- files changed;
- validations run;
- lockfile MD5 before/after;
- residual risks;
- next prompt to execute.
