# Master Prompt — Phase 17 Site Health Documentation Update

## Objective

Execute the full Wave 17 documentation update sequence in seven prompts, preserving documentation-only scope and repo-truth verification at every step.


## Required Instruction Phrase

Do not re-read files that are still within your current context or memory unless you need to verify stale, missing, or contradictory repo truth.

## Working Directory

`/Users/bobbyfetting/hb-intel`

## Global Guardrails

- Documentation-only unless this prompt explicitly says otherwise.
- Do not implement runtime code.
- Do not mutate packages, dependencies, manifests, lockfile, CI, tenants, Graph, SharePoint, Entra, external systems, settings, permissions, schemas, or secrets.
- Do not execute repair.
- Do not create production rollout artifacts.
- Do not make legal/accounting/claim/delay/entitlement determinations.
- Preserve Wave 14, Wave 15, and Wave 16 authority boundaries.


## Allowed Files / Likely Files

- This package itself.
- Future canonical Wave 17 blueprint docs.
- Future PCC list schema docs.

## Prohibited Scope

- Runtime source implementation.
- Broad formatting.
- Package or lockfile changes.
- Tenant or external-system calls.
- SharePoint/Graph/PnP/Entra mutation.
- SPFx packaging/deployment changes.

## Repo-Truth Files to Inspect

- `docs/architecture/blueprint/sp-project-control-center/phase-3/`
- `docs/architecture/blueprint/sp-project-control-center/phase-3/wave-16/`
- `docs/architecture/plans/MASTER/spfx/pcc/phase-03/wave-16/`
- `packages/models/src/pcc/SiteHealth.ts`
- `packages/models/src/pcc/fixtures/siteHealth.ts`
- `packages/project-site-template/schemas/families/site-health.schema.json`
- `packages/project-site-template/fields/families/site-health.fields.json`
- `docs/reference/sharepoint/list-schemas/pcc/List-Map.md`

## Steps


1. Run Prompt 01 and stop if repo truth contradicts package assumptions.
2. Execute Prompt 02 through Prompt 06 in order.
3. Execute Prompt 07 only after all documentation artifacts are complete and validated.
4. Keep commits scoped to each prompt unless the user instructs otherwise.
5. Never skip local repo-truth validation.
6. Do not re-read files already in context unless verification is needed.


## Validation Commands

```bash
git status --short
git branch --show-current
git rev-parse HEAD
git log --oneline -12
md5 pnpm-lock.yaml
git diff --check
pnpm exec prettier --check <touched markdown/json files>
git diff --name-only
git diff --cached --name-only
```



## Staged-File Proof Before Commit

Before commit, run:

```bash
git diff --cached --name-only
```

Include the staged files in the final response.

## Commit Summary and Description

Use a traditional commit summary.

Subject pattern:

`docs(pcc): <specific Wave 17 documentation update>`

Description must include:
- exact files changed;
- validation commands and outcomes;
- lockfile MD5 before and after;
- no-runtime/no-mutation attestation;
- residual risks.

## Final Output Requirements

Return:
- concise summary;
- files changed;
- validations run;
- lockfile MD5 before/after;
- residual risks;
- next prompt to execute.
