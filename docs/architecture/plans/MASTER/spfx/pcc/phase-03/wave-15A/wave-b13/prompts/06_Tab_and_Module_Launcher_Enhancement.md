# Phase 08 Prompt 06 — Tab and Module Launcher Enhancement

## Objective

Refine the top tabs and module dropdowns into a more premium, accessible module launcher experience.

## Global Execution Rules

These rules apply to this prompt and every later Phase 08 prompt.

1. Work in the `RMF112018/hb-intel` repo.
2. Treat this phase as **PCC Product Experience Enhancement**, not a CSS-only polish pass.
3. Preserve the current Phase 05/06/07 runtime architecture unless this prompt explicitly authorizes a narrow change.
4. Preserve the current eight primary-tab model:
   - `project-home`
   - `core-tools`
   - `documents`
   - `estimating-preconstruction`
   - `startup-closeout`
   - `project-controls`
   - `cost-time`
   - `systems-administration`
5. Do not reintroduce a permanent PCC sidebar.
6. Do not move `data-pcc-active-surface-panel` back to a card. It must remain shell-owned on `main[role="tabpanel"]`.
7. Preserve the bento direct-child invariant. Do not add wrappers between `PccBentoGrid` and `PccDashboardCard` unless the wrapper is itself an intentionally tested grid child and does not break layout.
8. Do not add dependencies. Do not add `echarts-for-react`. `echarts` direct usage remains the approved analytics approach.
9. Do not create live SharePoint, Graph, Procore, Sage, Azure, tenant, or app-catalog mutations.
10. Preserve read-only / preview / launch-only / no-writeback posture.
11. Do not introduce fake affordances. A non-working search/action/control must not appear live without clear preview or disabled state.
12. Do not put developer copy in the UI. Avoid end-user-visible words like `mock`, `placeholder`, `TODO`, `fixture`, or `demo` unless a governed preview/sample label already exists and is intentionally user-facing.
13. Do not weaken tests to pass. Update tests only when the expected product contract has intentionally changed.
14. Use stable `[data-*]` markers and semantic roles for tests. Do not test CSS module class names as behavior contracts.
15. Do not re-read files that are still within the current context or memory. Only open files needed to verify current repo truth, inspect drift, or make the scoped change.
16. If local repo truth differs from this package, classify the drift and proceed only when the change can be safely aligned without overwriting operator-owned work.


## Current Repo-Truth Assumptions

- Remote baseline observed when package was generated: `7d8bae430ab999d4fb38abe8de6689b89d8f4d27`.
- Current runtime model uses the eight primary tabs:
  `project-home`, `core-tools`, `documents`, `estimating-preconstruction`, `startup-closeout`, `project-controls`, `cost-time`, `systems-administration`.
- Local repo truth must be verified before edits.
- If local files have drifted, classify drift before editing.

## Scope

Preserve the current eight-tab model and keyboard behavior, but improve visual hierarchy, active states, disabled states, menu elevation, and module state clarity.

## Expected File Targets

```text
apps/project-control-center/src/shell/PccHorizontalTabs.tsx
apps/project-control-center/src/shell/PccHorizontalTabs.module.css
packages/models/src/pcc/PccPrimaryNavigation.ts
apps/project-control-center/src/tests/*HorizontalTabs*
apps/project-control-center/src/tests/*Navigation*

```

## Allowed Changes

- CSS and markup enhancements that preserve semantics.
- Additional data markers for evidence.
- Minor model copy refinements if no authority posture changes.

## Prohibited Changes

- Do not change tab IDs.
- Do not replace tabs with sidebar navigation.
- Do not make unselectable modules clickable.

## Required Steps

1. Inspect current tab/menu component and tests.
2. Refine selected, hover, pressed, focus-visible, and open menu states.
3. Improve dropdown visual treatment into a module launcher panel.
4. Preserve mouse click focus behavior and ArrowDown keyboard behavior.
5. Improve disabled/deferred/source-unavailable/launch-only visual distinction.
6. Add active module indicator treatment.
7. Add tests for state markers and keyboard behavior if not already sufficient.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Active tab is unmistakable.
- Module launcher/dropdown feels intentional and premium.
- Disabled/deferred modules are clearly non-active and explain why.
- Keyboard behavior preserved.
- No module false affordance introduced.
- No new dependency.

## Required Validation

```bash
git status --short
md5 pnpm-lock.yaml || md5sum pnpm-lock.yaml
pnpm --filter @hbc/spfx-project-control-center check-types
pnpm --filter @hbc/spfx-project-control-center test
pnpm exec prettier --check <changed-files>
git diff --check
md5 pnpm-lock.yaml || md5sum pnpm-lock.yaml
git status --short
```

## Closeout Requirements

Use `templates/Closeout_Template.md` and include:

- Starting and ending HEAD.
- Local drift classification.
- Files changed.
- Tests run and results.
- Lockfile md5 before/after.
- Evidence generated or blocked reason.
- Guardrails confirmed.
