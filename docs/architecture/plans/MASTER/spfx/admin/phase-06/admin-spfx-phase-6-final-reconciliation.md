## 1. What was created or updated

### New shared types (P6-03)
| File | Content |
|------|---------|
| `packages/models/src/admin-control-plane/IInstallBootstrap.ts` | `InstallStepId` (19), `IInstallStepDefinition`, `InstallStepFamily` (5), `InstallPreflightCheckId` (9), `InstallVerificationCheckId` (6), `INSTALL_ACTION_KEYS` |
| `packages/models/src/admin-control-plane/IAdminApi.ts` | Extended `IAdminPreflightCheck` with `category`, `severity`, `recommendedAction`, `resolvableByCheckpoint` |

### New backend services (P6-04 through P6-07)
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `backend/functions/src/services/admin-control-plane/preflight-service.ts` | `AdminPreflightService` — 9 checks, 6 categories |
| `backend/functions/src/services/admin-control-plane/install-orchestrator.ts` | `executeInstallRun()`, 19-step catalog, checkpoint pauses |
| `backend/functions/src/services/admin-control-plane/install-checkpoint-service.ts` | `processCheckpointDecision()`, `resumeAfterCheckpoint()`, `getCheckpointInstructions()` |
| `backend/functions/src/services/admin-control-plane/install-verification-service.ts` | `executeVerificationChecks()`, `runPostInstallVerification()` — 6 checks |

### New backend tests
| File | Tests |
|------|-------|
| `__tests__/preflight-service.test.ts` | 9-check stability, severity, blocking, recommended actions |
| `__tests__/install-orchestrator.test.ts` | Step catalog, sequencing, checkpoint pause, failure, cancellation |
| `__tests__/install-checkpoint-service.test.ts` | Instructions, approve/reject, terminal-state safety |
| `__tests__/install-verification-service.test.ts` | Check count, pass/fail, audit, evidence capture |

### Modified backend files
| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `service-factory.ts` | `AdminPreflightService` in proxy mode (stub kept for mock) |
| `adminApi/index.ts` | `adminCheckpointDecision` wired to real `processCheckpointDecision()` |
| `admin-control-plane/index.ts` | Barrel exports for all new services |

### New frontend pages (P6-08, P6-09)
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `apps/admin/src/pages/SetupWizardPage.tsx` | Preflight review, install launch, replaces scaffold |
| `apps/admin/src/pages/InstallRunDetailPage.tsx` | Run detail, step progress, checkpoint actions, verification |

### Modified frontend files
| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `routes.ts` | `/setup` → `SetupWizardPage`, added `/setup/run/$runId` route |
| `SetupWizardPage.tsx` | Auto-navigate to run detail after launch |

### Phase 6 documentation (12 canonical docs)

## 2. What repo-truth foundations were reused

| Foundation | Origin | Reused in Phase 6 |
|-----------|--------|-------------------|
| `AdminAdapterRegistry` + 10 descriptors | Phase 3 | Adapter invocation routing for all install steps |
| `DurableAdminRunStore` | Phase 4 | Install run persistence (domain: `setup-install`) |
| `DurableAdminAuditStore` | Phase 4 | Audit events for all install lifecycle events |
| `DurableAdminEvidenceStore` | Phase 4 | Evidence capture for preflight, verification reports |
| `IAdminRunEnvelope` / `AdminRunStatus` | Phase 2 | Run lifecycle — no new status values needed |
| `IAdminPreflightCheck` / response | Phase 2 | Extended with category/severity (backward compatible) |
| `IAdminPostRunValidationSummary` | Phase 2 | Verification result structure |
| `IAdminCheckpoint` contracts | Phase 2 | Checkpoint lifecycle types |
| Admin API endpoints (13) | Phases 3–4 | No new endpoints — install uses existing launch/status/checkpoint/audit |
| Health endpoint readiness probes | Phase 1 | `hasEnv()` pattern reused in preflight and verification |
| `createSessionTokenFactory()` | P3-09 | Token acquisition for frontend API calls |
| `AdminActorContextResolver` | P3-08 | Actor context for checkpoint decisions |
| `wave0-env-registry.ts` | Phase 1 | Environment variables for preflight checks |

**No new API endpoints, persistence tables, or external dependencies were introduced.**

## 3. Validation performed

### Verified

| Check | Command | Result |
|-------|---------|--------|
| Models typecheck | `pnpm --filter @hbc/models check-types` | **Pass** |
| Backend typecheck | `pnpm --filter @hbc/functions check-types` | **Pass** |
| Backend tests | `pnpm --filter @hbc/functions test` | **Pass** — 69 files, 1207 passed, 3 skipped |
| Admin lint | `pnpm --filter @hbc/spfx-admin lint` | **Pass** |
| Admin build | `pnpm --filter @hbc/spfx-admin build` | **Pass** — tsc + vite |
| Admin tests | `pnpm --filter @hbc/spfx-admin test` | **Partial** — 7/8 files pass; pre-existing ProvisioningOversightPage failure |

### Not run

| Check | Reason |
|-------|--------|
| E2E / Playwright | No E2E for admin app |
| Runtime install execution | Requires deployed Azure environment |
| Cross-app deep link test | Requires deployed multi-app environment |
| Workspace-wide build | Changes scoped to models, backend, admin app |

### Why this set

Phase 6 touched 3 packages: `@hbc/models` (type extension), `@hbc/functions` (4 new services + endpoint update), and `@hbc/spfx-admin` (2 new pages + route update). Each was validated at its own scope. Backend tests increased from 65 (pre-Phase 6) to 69 files / 1207 tests, confirming the 4 new test suites pass.

### Residual risk

| Risk | Assessment |
|------|-----------|
| Adapter invokers return `Skipped` (planned status) | Expected — real invokers will be created when Bicep/ARM templates and Graph/SharePoint operations are implemented |
| ProvisioningOversightPage tests remain broken | Pre-existing — TanStack Router mock issue, unrelated to Phase 6 |
| Install flow not runtime-tested end-to-end | Requires deployed Azure environment with managed identity |
| Checkpoint UX not tested with real external admin portals | Requires Entra and SharePoint admin center access |

---

## 4. Residual limitations

| Limitation | Severity | Target |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| Adapter invokers are planned (return Skipped) | Expected | Invokers will be implemented when IaC templates exist |
| No Bicep/ARM templates | Phase 6 scoped the architecture; IaC authoring is a deployment concern | DevOps / infrastructure workstream |
| SignalR real-time progress not wired | Low | Polling at 5s is sufficient; SignalR adapter is planned |
| No dedicated install run list in Setup lane | Low | Install runs visible via Runs lane; dedicated list deferred |
| Partial resume (restart from failed step) | Low | Full retry supported; step-level resume deferred to Phase 7+ |
| Verification uses config-presence checks, not live API probes | Low | Sufficient for Phase 6; live probes require deployed infrastructure |

---

## 5. Explicit Phase 6 non-goals still deferred

| Non-goal | Target |
|----------|--------|
| Full tenant-wide SharePoint active governance | Phase 7+ |
| Broad Entra admin workflow completion | Phase 9+ |
| Full standards/config registry | Phase 10+ |
| Full observability/alerting completion | Phase 13 |
| Generalized multi-domain admin platform rewrite | Not planned — extend incrementally |
| Bicep/ARM template authoring | DevOps / infrastructure workstream |
| SignalR real-time progress | Later phase |
| Config version snapshotting | Phase 10 |

---

## 6. Recommended next-phase entry point

**Phase 7 — Rollout, SharePoint control, and repair**

Phase 7 should begin by:
1. Auditing the SharePoint Control lane scaffold and existing SharePoint adapter descriptors
2. Implementing real adapter invokers for `sharepoint-site:lifecycle` and `sharepoint-alm:package-install`
3. Building SharePoint site provisioning and repair workflows in the `/sharepoint` lane
4. Extending the orchestrator pattern established in Phase 6 to SharePoint control operations

The Phase 6 install/bootstrap architecture (step catalog, adapter invocation, checkpoint pauses, audit/evidence capture, preflight/verification pattern) is the reusable foundation for all subsequent domain orchestration in the control center.

## Phase 6 acceptance criteria assessment

| # | Criterion | Status |
|---|-----------|--------|
| 1 | Admin can initiate setup/install from the Admin app | **Met** — SetupWizardPage with preflight and launch |
| 2 | Structured preflight results before install launch | **Met** — 9 checks, 6 categories, blocking/warning severity |
| 3 | Install execution runs through backend control plane | **Met** — `executeInstallRun()` via adapter registry |
| 4 | Manual approval gates surface as explicit checkpoint states | **Met** — 2 checkpoints with instructions, approve/reject, audit |
| 5 | Install progress and outcome reviewable in Admin app | **Met** — InstallRunDetailPage with 5s polling, step progress |
| 6 | Post-install verification runnable and reviewable | **Met** — 6 verification checks with structured results |
| 7 | Phase 6 docs explain the flow | **Met** — 13 canonical docs + operator runbook |
| 8 | Validation demonstrates compilation and behavior | **Met** — models/backend/admin all pass |
| 9 | Implementation does not collapse frontend/backend boundaries | **Met** — SPFx is command/review only; backend owns execution/persistence |
