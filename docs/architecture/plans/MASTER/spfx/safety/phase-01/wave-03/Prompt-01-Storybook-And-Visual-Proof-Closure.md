# Prompt 01 — Storybook And Visual Proof Closure

## Objective
Capture decisive visual proof that the rebuilt Safety homepage surface behaves credibly across the states and slot widths that matter.

## Governing authority
Governing authorities:
- `docs/reference/ui-kit/doctrine/UI-Doctrine-SPFx-Governing-Standard.md`
- `docs/reference/ui-kit/doctrine/UI-Doctrine-SPFx-Homepage-Overlay.md`
- `docs/reference/spfx-surfaces/benchmark/00-Plan-Summary.md`

Critical repo seams:
- `apps/hb-webparts/src/webparts/safetyFieldExcellence/SafetyFieldExcellence.tsx`
- `apps/hb-webparts/src/homepage/helpers/operationalAwarenessConfig.ts`
- `apps/hb-webparts/src/homepage/webparts/operationalAwarenessContracts.ts`

## Exact seams to inspect
- rebuilt safety surface stories
- any homepage/dev harness preview seams
- `scripts/capture-visual-proof.ts`
- any existing visual-proof workflow already used in the repo

## Current gap to close
The current repo has story coverage for the narrow safety variant, but the requested target requires stronger proof after the rebuild: not just a single narrow render, but a credible state matrix.

## Required implementation outcome
Produce proof for at least:
- standard mode
- compact mode
- minimal mode
- one-primary-signal case
- multiple-active-signals case
- stale-content case
- empty / invalid / runtime-error state where applicable
Use the repo’s preferred visual-proof workflow rather than inventing a new one without need.

## Proof of closure required
- attach the exact story names or preview routes used
- explain what each proof image/state is validating
- confirm no state regressed into generic card-grid behavior or visual stress

## Change boundaries
- Do not change unrelated homepage surfaces, hero logic, launcher behavior, or non-safety shared primitives unless required by the objective and explicitly justified in the closure note.
- Keep the sequence closure-oriented.
- Do not preserve weak implementation just because it already compiles.
- Do not re-read files that are already in active context unless needed to confirm drift, resolve dependencies, or verify uncertainty after changes.

## Delivery note
Return:
1. a concise repo-truth summary of what changed
2. the exact files changed
3. why the result now satisfies the objective
4. any follow-on risks or deferred items that are genuinely out of scope


## Checklist / scorecard closure gate
Use the attached **Homepage UI/UX Audit Checklist** and **Homepage UI/UX Audit Scorecard** while executing this prompt.

At the end of the task, include:
- the checklist categories materially improved by this work
- any checklist categories still below acceptable threshold in the touched scope
- a concise scorecard impact note (for example: “improves homepage integration quality from failing/poor toward adequate/strong”)
- any remaining hard-stop risks that prevent overall closure

Do not claim closure merely because the code compiles or the local preview looks better.
