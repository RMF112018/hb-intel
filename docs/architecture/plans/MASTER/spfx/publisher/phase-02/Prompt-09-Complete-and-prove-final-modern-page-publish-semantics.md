# Prompt-09 — Complete and prove final modern-page publish semantics

Use this in a fresh local code-agent session.

```text
You are working in the live local HB Intel repo.

Primary repo:
https://github.com/RMF112018/hb-intel.git

Objective:
Harden the publish pipeline so a successful publish truly makes the modern page live, not just canvas-updated.

Critical operating instruction:
Do not re-read files that are already in your active context unless needed to confirm drift, dependencies, or uncertainty after changes.

Mandatory authority:
- /Users/bobbyfetting/hb-intel/docs/architecture/plans/MASTER/spfx/publisher/architecture/lists/publisher-list-schema-report.md
- docs/architecture/plans/MASTER/spfx/publisher/architecture/publisher-rebranding-report.md
- /mnt/data/03-Findings-Register.md
- /mnt/data/04-Recommended-Remediation-Sequence.md

Working posture:
- This is a tightly bounded remediation task for one gap only.
- Do not redesign adjacent systems.
- Do not make unrelated refactors.
- Do not collapse this into a broader multi-gap rewrite.
- Preserve the Article Publisher rebrand.
- Preserve Project Spotlight as the current destination identity where the rebranding report explicitly says it remains valid.
- Treat the tenant list schema as the source of truth when code conflicts with prior assumptions.

Files to inspect first:
- `pageGeneration/pageCreationService.ts`
- `pageGeneration/pageShellService.ts`
- `publishOrchestrator.ts`
- publish tests

Required changes:
1. Audit the current page-creation/update flow and implement the explicit final modern-page publish step if it is missing.
2. Keep the creation/update and publish responsibilities clearly separated and testable.
3. Add proof in code and tests that the final publish lifecycle step executes on create and republish paths where required.
4. Do not broaden this prompt into unrelated page-composition redesign.

Implementation discipline:
- Scrub the full bounded seam for stale assumptions related to this gap.
- Update code, tests, and nearby comments only where required to close this gap cleanly.
- Keep behavior deterministic and testable.
- Where a prior abstraction is wrong for the tenant model, fix the abstraction rather than layering a fragile compatibility patch on top.
- Do not move on to any later remediation category until this one is fully closed.

Verification required:
- Run targeted tests for the changed seam.
- Run `pnpm --filter @hbc/spfx-hb-webparts check-types`.
- Add or update tests so this exact drift cannot silently regress.
- In your final report, explicitly prove the following exit criteria are satisfied:
- The pipeline contains a clear final modern-page publish action.
- Tests or well-bounded integration seams prove that live page publication occurs.
- No publish path reports success while skipping the final page publish lifecycle step.

Required final deliverables in your response:
1. Concise summary of exactly what changed
2. File-by-file change list
3. Verification performed and results
4. Any residual risks that are truly out of scope for this prompt
```
