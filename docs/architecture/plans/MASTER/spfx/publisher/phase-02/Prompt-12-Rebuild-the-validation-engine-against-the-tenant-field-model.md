# Prompt-12 — Rebuild the validation engine against the tenant field model

Use this in a fresh local code-agent session.

You are working in the live local HB Intel repo.

Primary repo:
https://github.com/RMF112018/hb-intel.git

Objective:
Scrub validation logic so it only references real tenant fields, real template metadata, and real binding semantics.

Critical operating instruction:
Do not re-read files that are already in your active context unless needed to confirm drift, dependencies, or uncertainty after changes.

Mandatory authority:
- /Users/bobbyfetting/hb-intel/docs/architecture/plans/MASTER/spfx/publisher/architecture/lists/publisher-list-schema-report.md
- docs/architecture/plans/MASTER/spfx/publisher/architecture/publisher-rebranding-report.md
- /mnt/data/03-Findings-Register.md
- /mnt/data/04-Recommended-Remediation-Sequence.md

Working posture:
- This is a tightly bounded remediation task for one gap only.
- Do not redesign adjacent systems.
- Do not make unrelated refactors.
- Do not collapse this into a broader multi-gap rewrite.
- Preserve the Article Publisher rebrand.
- Preserve Project Spotlight as the current destination identity where the rebranding report explicitly says it remains valid.
- Treat the tenant list schema as the source of truth when code conflicts with prior assumptions.

Files to inspect first:
- `validation/validationEngine.ts`
- related tests

Required changes:
1. Replace obsolete field checks and template assumptions with the actual tenant-aligned article, template, and binding model.
2. Keep the engine structurally rich, but ensure every validation message and block condition points to real tenant fields only.
3. Update tests so both valid and invalid cases reflect actual tenant schema reality.

Implementation discipline:
- Scrub the full bounded seam for stale assumptions related to this gap.
- Update code, tests, and nearby comments only where required to close this gap cleanly.
- Keep behavior deterministic and testable.
- Where a prior abstraction is wrong for the tenant model, fix the abstraction rather than layering a fragile compatibility patch on top.
- Do not move on to any later remediation category until this one is fully closed.

Verification required:
- Run targeted tests for the changed seam.
- Run `pnpm --filter @hbc/spfx-hb-webparts check-types`.
- Add or update tests so this exact drift cannot silently regress.
- In your final report, explicitly prove the following exit criteria are satisfied:
- Validation findings reference only real tenant fields.
- Valid tenant data is not blocked by obsolete schema assumptions.
- Validation tests pass against the new schema.

Required final deliverables in your response:
1. Concise summary of exactly what changed
2. File-by-file change list
3. Verification performed and results
4. Any residual risks that are truly out of scope for this prompt
```
