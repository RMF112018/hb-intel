# Prompt-07 — Implement real `HB Article Publishing Errors` persistence

Use this in a fresh local code-agent session.

```text
You are working in the live local HB Intel repo.

Primary repo:
https://github.com/RMF112018/hb-intel.git

Objective:
Close the intentional no-op gap so publish failures are written to the authoritative tenant error list.

Critical operating instruction:
Do not re-read files that are already in your active context unless needed to confirm drift, dependencies, or uncertainty after changes.

Mandatory authority:
- /Users/bobbyfetting/hb-intel/docs/architecture/plans/MASTER/spfx/publisher/architecture/lists/publisher-list-schema-report.md
- docs/architecture/plans/MASTER/spfx/publisher/architecture/publisher-rebranding-report.md
- /mnt/data/03-Findings-Register.md
- /mnt/data/04-Recommended-Remediation-Sequence.md

Working posture:
- This is a tightly bounded remediation task for one gap only.
- Do not redesign adjacent systems.
- Do not make unrelated refactors.
- Do not collapse this into a broader multi-gap rewrite.
- Preserve the Article Publisher rebrand.
- Preserve Project Spotlight as the current destination identity where the rebranding report explicitly says it remains valid.
- Treat the tenant list schema as the source of truth when code conflicts with prior assumptions.

Files to inspect first:
- `publisherRepositories.ts`
- new or updated writer/mapping files
- publish-path tests

Required changes:
1. Implement a real publishing-errors repository/writer against `HB Article Publishing Errors`.
2. Map the actual tenant error-list fields and use `ArticleId` linkage.
3. Integrate it into the publish pipeline so resolution, validation, page-generation, page-publish, and binding failures can be captured with actionable detail.
4. Add tests that prove append behavior and failure-path invocation.

Implementation discipline:
- Scrub the full bounded seam for stale assumptions related to this gap.
- Update code, tests, and nearby comments only where required to close this gap cleanly.
- Keep behavior deterministic and testable.
- Where a prior abstraction is wrong for the tenant model, fix the abstraction rather than layering a fragile compatibility patch on top.
- Do not move on to any later remediation category until this one is fully closed.

Verification required:
- Run targeted tests for the changed seam.
- Run `pnpm --filter @hbc/spfx-hb-webparts check-types`.
- Add or update tests so this exact drift cannot silently regress.
- In your final report, explicitly prove the following exit criteria are satisfied:
- `publishingErrors.append()` is implemented and tenant-aligned.
- Publish failures write error rows instead of throwing a not-implemented error.
- Tests cover at least one failure-path error write.

Required final deliverables in your response:
1. Concise summary of exactly what changed
2. File-by-file change list
3. Verification performed and results
4. Any residual risks that are truly out of scope for this prompt
