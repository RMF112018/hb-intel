# 05 — Prompt 01 — Repo Truth and Impact Map

```text
You are working in the live local HB Intel repo.

Objective:
Conduct an exhaustive repo-truth audit to determine the exact owning SPFx app/package, any existing publisher/news/article/page-generation code paths that are relevant, and the minimum-clean implementation path for the new Project Spotlight publisher application.

Critical operating instruction:
Do not re-read files that are already in your active context unless needed to confirm drift, dependencies, or uncertainty after changes.

Binding architecture authority:
Treat the following local files as implementation authority:
- /Users/bobbyfetting/hb-intel/docs/architecture/plans/MASTER/spfx/publisher/architecture/README.md
- /Users/bobbyfetting/hb-intel/docs/architecture/plans/MASTER/spfx/publisher/architecture/00-Plan-Summary.md
- /Users/bobbyfetting/hb-intel/docs/architecture/plans/MASTER/spfx/publisher/architecture/01-Full-Detail-Product-and-Content-Model.md
- /Users/bobbyfetting/hb-intel/docs/architecture/plans/MASTER/spfx/publisher/architecture/02-List-By-List-Architecture.md
- /Users/bobbyfetting/hb-intel/docs/architecture/plans/MASTER/spfx/publisher/architecture/03-Exact-Field-Definitions.md
- /Users/bobbyfetting/hb-intel/docs/architecture/plans/MASTER/spfx/publisher/architecture/04-Child-Record-Relationships.md
- /Users/bobbyfetting/hb-intel/docs/architecture/plans/MASTER/spfx/publisher/architecture/05-Template-Registry-Schema.md
- /Users/bobbyfetting/hb-intel/docs/architecture/plans/MASTER/spfx/publisher/architecture/06-Article-Page-Binding-Schema.md
- /Users/bobbyfetting/hb-intel/docs/architecture/plans/MASTER/spfx/publisher/architecture/07-Webpart-Input-Contracts.md
- /Users/bobbyfetting/hb-intel/docs/architecture/plans/MASTER/spfx/publisher/architecture/08-Validation-Rules-by-Template.md
- /Users/bobbyfetting/hb-intel/docs/architecture/plans/MASTER/spfx/publisher/architecture/09-Editorial-Workflow-and-Lifecycle.md
- /Users/bobbyfetting/hb-intel/docs/architecture/plans/MASTER/spfx/publisher/architecture/10-Implementation-Notes-and-Evolution-Rules.md
- the Project Spotlight XML template saved in this same folder

Global rules:
- Project Spotlight is the only destination.
- Do not preserve or reintroduce Company Pulse or dual-destination article-publisher logic.
- The XML template is the canonical v1 page-shell authority.
- The current shell uses OOB Page Title/banner, OOB Text for subheading, OOB Text for body, Team Viewer, and OOB Image Gallery.
- Do not force hbSignatureHero into v1 unless you intentionally introduce a new approved shell variant and update architecture accordingly.
- The destination page is a rendered shell, not the source of editorial truth.
- The post master record and related child records are the source of editorial truth.
- Publish/republish must use durable page bindings with shell/template version tracking.
- Do not make unrelated refactors.

Required delivery behavior:
- Perform exhaustive repo-truth review within the scope of this prompt before changing code.
- Make the minimum clean changes required to fully close the scoped objective.
- Update docs/comments where necessary so the implementation stays understandable.
- Produce concrete evidence of closure.

Prompt-specific requirements:
- Identify the exact code locations that should own:
  - the publisher UI
  - list/data services
  - page-generation logic
  - binding logic
  - Team Viewer integration
- Determine what can be reused, what must be refactored, and what must be isolated or abandoned.
- Explicitly find and flag any stale Company Pulse or dual-destination assumptions.
- Confirm whether an existing publisher app exists or whether a new SPFx surface must be created.
- Produce a file-by-file impact map with recommended action per file.
- Do not begin broad implementation work yet; this prompt is for discovery, impact mapping, and scope locking.

Required outputs before you stop:
- repo-truth findings summary
- file-by-file impact map
- recommended owning package/app
- reuse/refactor/replace matrix
- list of blocking unknowns, if any
- implementation tracker initialized in the repo
```
