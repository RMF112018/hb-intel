# Project Spotlight Publisher — Implementation Tracker

Initialized: 2026-04-13 (Wave 1 / Prompt-01 closure).

Single source of truth for wave-by-wave execution status. Update this file as each wave closes. Cross-reference closure artifacts under `evidence/`.

## Wave 1 Outputs

- Repo-truth findings summary → `evidence/wave-01-repo-truth-and-impact-map.md`
- File-by-file impact map → same artifact, §4
- Recommended owning package/app → same artifact, §1 + §8 (`apps/hb-webparts` + local `homepage/data/projectSpotlight*` modules layered over `@hbc/sharepoint-platform`)
- Reuse / refactor / replace matrix → same artifact, §5
- Blocking unknowns → same artifact, §6
- Implementation tracker initialized → this file

## Blocking Unknowns Queue (resolve before / during Wave 2)

1. SharePoint Pages REST API path + auth model for ProjectSpotlight site.
2. Webpart property injection strategy at page-generation time.
3. Photo hydration timing (generation-time embed vs. runtime fetch).
4. Publish permissions / service principal on ProjectSpotlight.
5. Rollback / version-history policy.
6. Scheduled publishing inclusion + trigger mechanism.
7. OOB Image Gallery layout variant.

## Handoff Notes

- Do not re-read Architecture docs `00-10` unless scope changes; they are authoritative and locked.
- Do not modify `@hbc/sharepoint-platform` public API during Waves 2–9; extend only via local modules.
- Do not reintroduce Company Pulse, `HbcNewsroomSurface`, or dual-destination logic in publisher authoring.
- Do not force `hbSignatureHero` into v1 shell; architecture doc 10 must change first if a shell variant is added.
- Team Viewer webpart is ready to mount in generated pages; no renderer changes required there.
