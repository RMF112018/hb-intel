# 08 — Prompt 04 — XML Shell Page-Generation Engine

```text
You are working in the live local HB Intel repo.

Objective:
Build the page-generation engine that treats the saved Project Spotlight XML artifact as the canonical v1 shell and creates/updates Project Spotlight pages from that shell.

Critical operating instruction:
Do not re-read files that are already in your active context unless needed to confirm drift, dependencies, or uncertainty after changes.

Binding architecture authority:
Treat the following local files as implementation authority:
- /Users/bobbyfetting/hb-intel/docs/architecture/plans/MASTER/spfx/publisher/architecture/README.md
- /Users/bobbyfetting/hb-intel/docs/architecture/plans/MASTER/spfx/publisher/architecture/00-Plan-Summary.md
- /Users/bobbyfetting/hb-intel/docs/architecture/plans/MASTER/spfx/publisher/architecture/01-Full-Detail-Product-and-Content-Model.md
- /Users/bobbyfetting/hb-intel/docs/architecture/plans/MASTER/spfx/publisher/architecture/02-List-By-List-Architecture.md
- /Users/bobbyfetting/hb-intel/docs/architecture/plans/MASTER/spfx/publisher/architecture/03-Exact-Field-Definitions.md

- /Users/bobbyfetting/hb-intel/docs/architecture/plans/MASTER/spfx/publisher/architecture/10-Implementation-Notes-and-Evolution-Rules.md
- the Project Spotlight XML template saved in this same folder

Global rules:
- Project Spotlight is the only destination.
- Do not preserve or reintroduce Company Pulse or dual-destination article-publisher logic.
- The XML template is the canonical v1 page-shell authority.
- The current shell uses OOB Page Title/banner, OOB Text for subheading, OOB Text for body, Team Viewer, and OOB Image Gallery.
- Do not force hbSignatureHero into v1 unless you intentionally introduce a new approved shell variant and update architecture accordingly.
- The destination page is a rendered shell, not the source of editorial truth.
- The post master record and related child records are the source of editorial truth.
- Publish/republish must use durable page bindings with shell/template version tracking.
- Do not make unrelated refactors.

Required delivery behavior:
- Perform exhaustive repo-truth review within the scope of this prompt before changing code.
- Make the minimum clean changes required to fully close the scoped objective.
- Update docs/comments where necessary so the implementation stays understandable.
- Produce concrete evidence of closure.

Prompt-specific requirements:
- Determine the correct repo location for XML-shell processing and page-generation logic.
- Build a shell service that references, interprets, or copies from the saved XML template as appropriate for the repo’s SharePoint/PnP implementation pattern.
- Create the destination page at the Project Spotlight site and ensure the implementation respects the shell’s expected structure.
- Track shell identity/version in a durable way that can later support regeneration logic.
- Do not bypass the shell by hardcoding an alternate page composition path unless architecture is updated and the change is documented.
- Validate that the resulting page contains the expected v1 zones:
  - banner/title
  - subheading text
  - body text
  - Team Viewer
  - image gallery

Required outputs before you stop:
- shell service
- page creation/update service
- shell version strategy
- evidence that the generated page aligns to the XML shell structure
- notes on any unavoidable implementation constraints
```
