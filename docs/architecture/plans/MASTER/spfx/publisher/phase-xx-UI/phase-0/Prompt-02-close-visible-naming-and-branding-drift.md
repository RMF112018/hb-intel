    # Prompt 02 — Close visible naming and branding drift

    ## Objective

    Execute **Wave 0 — Stabilize hosted truth and eliminate visible drift / Step 02** for the Article Publisher remediation program.

    Step goal:
    Remove legacy naming from the live authoring surface so the product consistently presents itself as Article Publisher while preserving the legacy GUID lineage only in technical runtime contract history.

    ## Critical operating instruction

    Do not re-read files that are already in your active context unless needed to confirm drift, dependencies, or uncertainty after changes.

    ## Mandatory authority

    Treat the following as binding authority and do not proceed in a way that violates them:

    - docs/reference/ui-kit/doctrine/UI-Doctrine-SPFx-Governing-Standard.md
- docs/reference/ui-kit/doctrine/UI-Doctrine-SPFx-Homepage-Overlay.md

    Also treat the current live local repo on `main` as implementation truth, especially these seams where relevant:

    - apps/hb-webparts/src/webparts/articlePublisher/ArticlePublisher.tsx
- apps/hb-webparts/src/webparts/articlePublisher/article-publisher.module.css
- apps/hb-webparts/src/webparts/articlePublisher/ArticlePublisherWebPart.manifest.json
- apps/hb-webparts/src/webparts/articlePublisher/runtimeContract.ts
- apps/hb-webparts/src/mount.tsx
- apps/hb-webparts/src/homepage/data/publisherAdapter/index.ts
- apps/hb-webparts/src/homepage/data/publisherAdapter/publisherEnums.ts
- apps/hb-webparts/src/homepage/data/publisherAdapter/publisherContracts.ts
- apps/hb-webparts/src/homepage/data/publisherAdapter/publisherListDescriptors.ts
- apps/hb-webparts/src/homepage/data/publisherAdapter/publisherRepositories.ts

    Additional step-specific focus files and folders:
    - apps/hb-webparts/src/webparts/articlePublisher/ArticlePublisher.tsx
- apps/hb-webparts/src/webparts/articlePublisher/ArticlePublisherWebPart.manifest.json
- apps/hb-webparts/src/webparts/articlePublisher/runtimeContract.ts
- apps/hb-webparts/src/mount.tsx
- docs/architecture/plans/MASTER/spfx/publisher/architecture/publisher-rebranding-report.md

    ## Delivery posture

    - This is a **targeted remediation task**, not a broad redesign beyond this step’s scope.
    - Make the smallest complete change set that closes the step properly.
    - Do not leave partial UX drift behind if it is directly inside the touched seam.
    - Do not preserve a weak legacy behavior when this prompt explicitly requires replacing it.
    - Do not regress publish orchestration, validation, preview, page binding, or list schema alignment while executing this step.

    ## Required work

    1. Conduct a repo-truth impact scan for this step’s focus area.
    2. Implement the remediation fully, including any necessary UI, adapter, contract, helper, or validation updates inside scope.
    3. Scrub touched seams for drift so the issue is **actually closed**, not just cosmetically improved.
    4. Run the most appropriate validation available in repo context.
    5. Produce a closure note in the wave folder summarizing:
       - files changed
       - implementation summary
       - validation performed
       - hosted/deployment follow-up needed, if any
       - residual risk, if any

    ## Step deliverables

    - Replace any remaining author-facing `Project Spotlight posts`, `Untitled spotlight`, or similar drifted labels with current product/destination language.
- Keep legacy deployment lineage confined to technical comments where justified.
- Produce a naming audit note proving there is no author-facing rebrand drift left in scope.

    ## Acceptance criteria

    - No author-facing UI string suggests the app itself is still named `Project Spotlight Publisher`.
- Destination-specific language is used only where the destination is the subject, not the app identity.
- Manifest/runtime identity remains technically correct while the UI is consistently rebranded.

    ## Required validation

    At minimum, do the following as applicable to this step:

    - Typecheck / lint / test only what is needed to validate the touched seam
    - Verify no obvious doctrine regression was introduced
    - Verify no author-facing naming drift or raw-system-value drift was introduced inside touched scope
    - Verify touched UI states still behave reasonably for empty / loading / partial / error conditions

    ## Output requirements

    When complete, provide:
    1. concise implementation summary
    2. exact files changed
    3. validation run and results
    4. closure note path
    5. any remaining follow-up needed before the next prompt

    ## Guardrails

    - Do not broaden scope into later waves unless necessary to prevent direct breakage.
    - Do not invent new tenant schema fields unless the existing architecture explicitly requires them.
    - Do not degrade the current publish lifecycle, workflow-history, or binding logic to make UI work easier.
    - Do not leave TODO-only placeholders where a complete implementation is reasonably achievable in this step.
