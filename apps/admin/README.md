# @hbc/spfx-admin

Admin SPFx web part for HB Intel — the **operator console** for the IT Control Center.

This app is the human-facing shell where authorized admins observe, initiate, and manage IT control actions. It is **not** the privileged executor — privileged and long-running work belongs in the backend control plane (`backend/functions`). See the [Phase 1 architecture baseline](../../docs/architecture/plans/MASTER/spfx/admin/phase-01/admin-spfx-phase-1-architecture-baseline.md) for the full operating model.

**Contract consumption**: This app consumes shared admin control-plane contracts from `@hbc/models/admin-control-plane` for type-safe API calls and display. It does not own or define those contracts. See the [package placement map](../../docs/architecture/plans/MASTER/spfx/admin/phase-02/admin-control-plane-package-placement-and-boundary-map.md).

## Operator Console

The admin app is organized as an 8-lane operator console (Phase 5). The **landing page** (`/`) shows an overview grid of all workflow lanes. Three lanes have active content from existing pages that were rehomed into the lane model; four lanes are scaffolds that render clear `HbcSmartEmptyState` placeholders indicating which future phase delivers the content. The Error / Audit lane preserves its deferred state (SF17-T05).

Navigation is lane-driven — the shell renders all 8 lane buttons derived from the canonical lane registry (`src/router/lane-registry.ts`). Active lanes appear at full opacity; scaffold lanes appear dimmed. The alert badge on the Health lane is preserved.

### Lanes

| Route | Lane | Page | Status |
|-------|------|------|--------|
| `/` | — | Operator Landing | Active — control-center overview with lane grid |
| `/setup` | Setup / Install | SetupLanePage | Scaffold — Phase 6 |
| `/validation` | Validation | ValidationLanePage | Scaffold — Phase 7 |
| `/runs` | Runs / History | ProvisioningOversightPage | Active — monitor, retry, escalate, archive provisioning runs |
| `/sharepoint` | SharePoint Control | SharePointLanePage | Scaffold — Phase 7 |
| `/entra` | Entra Control | EntraLanePage | Scaffold — Phase 9 |
| `/config` | Standards / Config | SystemSettingsPage | Active — access control and approval authority configuration |
| `/health` | Health / Alerts | OperationalDashboardPage | Active — alert summary, probe health, infrastructure status |
| `/errors` | Error / Audit | ErrorLogPage | Deferred — SF17-T05 |

### Legacy redirects (backward compatibility)

| Old route | Redirects to | Reason |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| `/provisioning-failures` | `/runs` (preserves `?projectId=`) | Cross-app deep links from Accounting and Estimating |
| `/dashboards` | `/health` | Bookmarks and internal links |
| `/error-log` | `/errors` | Bookmarks and internal links |

## Development

```bash
pnpm --filter @hbc/spfx-admin dev             # Dev server (port 4006)
pnpm --filter @hbc/spfx-admin build           # Type-check + build
pnpm --filter @hbc/spfx-admin lint            # Lint
pnpm --filter @hbc/spfx-admin test            # Run tests
pnpm --filter @hbc/spfx-admin test:coverage   # Run tests with coverage
```

## Alert and Probe Polling

The admin app runs two background polling services when a backend URL is configured:

- **AlertPollingService** (`services/alertPollingService.ts`) — polls for active provisioning alerts at a configurable interval. Drives the failures inbox badge count and alert summary on the Operational Dashboards page.
- **useProbePolling** (`hooks/useProbePolling.ts`) — polls infrastructure health probes (Azure Functions, SharePoint) and surfaces results on the dashboards page.

Both services skip polling when no backend URL is configured (dev-harness without backend), preventing DOCTYPE parse errors from HTML fallback responses.

## Deferred Pages

### Error Log (SF17-T05)

The Error Log page is intentionally deferred. It renders a clear `HbcSmartEmptyState` from `@hbc/smart-empty-state` so the route never appears blank. All admin alert and monitoring functionality is available in the Provisioning Oversight dashboard.

Tracked in: SF17-T05 (error logging and audit trail).
